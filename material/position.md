**What is Positional Encoding (and what you just did)?**

In **normal word embeddings** (like "cat", "dog", "lion", "NYC"), we map words into **vectors** based on their meaning — but **without** any information about their **order** or **position**.

However, when we deal with sequences (like a sentence: "the cat sat on the mat"), **position matters**!  
We need a way for the model to know which word comes first, second, third, etc.  
**Positional encoding** solves this by **adding position information** into the embeddings.

**Why do we use sine and cosine?**

We use **sine** and **cosine** functions because:

- They create **smooth and continuous patterns**.
- They allow the model to easily learn **relative positions** (like "word A is closer to word B" if their position vectors are similar).
- They naturally have **different frequencies** — big changes for early dimensions, smaller changes for later dimensions.  This gives the model a "sense" of **both local** and **global** positions.
  
**Example:**  
- A sine wave for dimension 1 might change slowly across positions.  
- A sine wave for dimension 10 might change faster across positions.  
Thus, every position gets a **unique pattern**!

**Why do we *add* positional encoding to embeddings?**

In the code:

```python
position_aware_embeddings = initial_embeddings + position_vectors
```

The model now **mixes meaning and position together** into one vector.
- Later layers (transformers, attention, etc.) **don't have to separately look for position** — it’s already "baked in" to the vector.
- It's **simple and efficient**: addition is fast, no extra memory needed.

This helps the model understand both **what** the token is and **where** it is in the sequence, **without extra complexity**.

**But some models use concatenation (not addition)**

Models like **T5** and some other newer models **concatenate** the positional encoding instead of adding it.

- Instead of adding numbers to each embedding dimension, they **stick position info at the end**.
- This **makes the embedding longer** (e.g., 768 dimensions + 64 dimensions of position = 832 total).
- Then the model can **separately learn** what part of the vector is "meaning" and what part is "position".

Both approaches (add vs concat) work, but:

| Add | Concat |
|:---|:---|
| Easy and fast | More flexible |
| Blends meaning and position together | Keeps meaning and position separate |
| Used by original Transformer, BERT, GPT | Used by T5, BigBird, newer models |
