**Instructions:**

1.  **Topic Assignment**:
    *   Groups 1, 4, 7, 12: **TinyML** (Focus: The underlying philosophy, goals, and types of resources available, building on the lecture).
    *   Groups 2, 5, 10, 13: **Edge Impulse** (Focus: What the platform does end-to-end, key features, types of projects it enables).
    *   Groups 3, 6, 11: **SensiML** (Focus: What the platform does end-to-end, key features, how it might compare/contrast with other tools).
    *   Each group will focus on understanding and discussing their assigned topic using the provided resources and lecture notes.

2.  **Presentation Preparation**:
    *   Discuss the assigned topic within your group, referring back to the concepts covered in the lecture.
    *   Use the "Useful Resources" listed below to find specific details. Focus on answering:
        *   What is the main purpose or goal of this topic/platform?
        *   What are 1-2 key features or benefits?
        *   What is one interesting example application (from their website, the resources, or your own ideas based on the lecture)?
    *   **Tool Usage**: You may use Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc., to assist your research and understanding. However, ensure you understand the information yourself. Be prepared to explain the concepts in your own terms.
    *   Prepare a brief (approx. 5-minute) summary presentation to share your findings. Focus on clarity and the main points. You can use **Google Slides** to create your presentation: [https://slides.google.com/](https://slides.google.com/).

3.  **Presentations**:
    *   One group chosen at random *for each topic* (TinyML, Edge Impulse, SensiML) will present their summary (approx. 5 minutes per group, plus transition time).
    *   The presenting group should share their understanding of the concepts, illustrated with details about their specific topic, and briefly reflect on its relevance to potential IoT projects or areas of interest.
